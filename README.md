AiCore project

End of week 2, a little python programming challenge

I've followed instructions exactly, but I think there are some improvements to the gameplay if I had been allowed them! They're commented out in the code :-)

Rather than working from the small word list in the code, I used an api to return a random word. Seems to give a nice, rapid response.
